# Setup Printing For Android

Our system allows you to manually and automatically print out new orders. This guide will show you how to set order printing and troubleshoot issues.

\|\| We are happy to remotely set up your printer for you. We know this is a step that can trip up many people due to every printer being a bit different. Please get in touch with us if you need assistance.

## Requirements

* An Android device with Android 1.4 or above
* A ESC/POS compatible printer
* Latest version of PushPrinter that can be downloaded [here](https://www.pushprinter.com)

## Setup Process

### Create A Printer Configuration

1. Visit your restaurant dashboard and navigate to "Settings &gt; Receipt Printing"
2. Press the "New Printer" button and fill out any options needed
3. On the "Printer Settings" tab, set your Printer Method to 'ESCPOS' and ESCPOS Printing Type to 'ESCPOS Image'.  Note that some older printers may not support this method and ESCPOS Text Only can be used in these cases.
4. The defauly paper settings work for most printers.  If the test print is cutting of the edge of the text, please adjust the Paper Scale Factor to 1.7 and test again.
5. Create the print configuration. After creating it, you will get a unique API key to connect to it. Keep this screen open as you will need to copy your API key soon.
