# Payments & Billing

## Add A Payment Method

We currently only accept, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. To add a payment method you must:

1. Visit [https://admin.cloudwaitress.com](https://admin.cloudwaitress.com) and login
2. Click **billing** on a restaurant in your restaurant list
3. In the popup, select "Payment Methods" and enter your card details

## Cancelled Accounts

If your account has been cancelled due to a failed payment, you will no longer be able to accept orders. However, your store will still remain online and all your information will be kept.

## Refunds

Refunds will only be provided if our platform fails to meet its stated role when being used. Please contact us to discuss this.
