## Billing Cycle

You will be billed on the same day that your account was activated every month.

## Failed Payments

If your payment fails, we will inform you and attempt to charge your card again in 24 hours. If it fails again, we will retry in 3 days and 3 days after if that fails. If the 3rd payment retry fails within 7 days of your initial failed payment, your account will be cancelled.

## Cancelled Accounts

If your account has been cancelled due to a failed payment, you will no longer be able to accept orders. However, your store will still remain online and all your information will be kept.

## Re-Activating Your Subscription

If your account is cancelled, add a valid payment method to re-active your subscription.

## Refunds

Refunds will only be provided if our platform fails to meet its stated role when being used. Please contact us to discuss this.
